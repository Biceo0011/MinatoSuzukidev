Hi. everyone!
I am a full stack developer with a wide range of skills.
 In my job, I have worked with a wide range of sites of any complexity, from the simple responsive landing page to overloaded sites with big-data structure and marketplace. I prefer to use Git as a control version system, VS code, tslint, eslint for more clear code, Trello / Jira as task tracking systems.
First of all, I'm exploring the aim of a new project and propose my ideas about how to improve and make a more profitable solution.
I have delivered performant solutions across the following domains:

- Financial Trading
- Applied Machine Learning
- Web Development
- Mobile Apps
- Game Development

- Main development experiences
Blockchain, WordPress, Shopify, Laravel, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, PHP

-Blockchain

- Backend

Languages: C# | C/C++ | Python | Javascript/Typescript | Rust

I am a solo developer and work on every aspect of the project myself so you can rest assured you are directly interacting with me.
Thank you
